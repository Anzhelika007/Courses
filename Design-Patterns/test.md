-[ ] Facade  
-[ ] Adapter  
-[ ] Singleton

19. Cons of Command(Action) pattern:

-[ ] complicates the code by introducing additional classes  
-[ ] undo/redo can't be implemented

-[ ] Flyweight  
-[ ] Facade  
-[ ] Decorator  
-[ ] Composite  
-[ ] Bridge  
-[ ] Adapter

21. Which design pattern lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation?

-[ ] Command  
-[ ] Prototype  
-[ ] Memento  
-[ ] Mediator  
-[ ] Observer

22. Visitor is:

-[ ] behavioral design pattern  
-[ ] creational design pattern  
-[ ] structural design pattern  
-[ ] there is no correct answer

23. Pros of Mediator pattern:

-[ ] allows to reduce the coupling between components  
-[ ] simplifies communication between components  
-[ ] extracts the communications between various components into a single place

24. Iterator is:

-[ ] design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate  
-[ ] design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation  
-[ ] design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation  
-[ ] design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing

25. In which cases is the Strategy pattern used?

-[ ] when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior  
-[ ] when your class has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm  
-[ ] when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object

-[ ] Adapter  
-[ ] Bridge  
-[ ] Singleton  
-[ ] State  
-[ ] Proxy

27. Controller in the MVC pattern:

-[ ] manages data and business logic  
-[ ] responsible for displaying the data to the user  
-[ ] accepts and handles data from the model  
-[ ] there is no correct answer

29. Classic MVC standard includes:

-[ ] unidirectional data flow  
-[ ] bidirectional data flow 30. Is it true that you can implement shared leaf nodes of the Composite tree as Flyweights to save some RAM?  
-[ ] yes  
-[ ] no

31. Which design pattern helps multiple objects stay up-to-date with the latest changes of a subscription object?

-[ ] Strategy  
-[ ] Observer  
-[ ] Decorator
