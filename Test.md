[] method test.toBeDone
[] using the it.todo method
[] using the it.future method

2. What mock objects are used in testing?

mocks
stubs
interfaces
spies
fields

3. Which type of mock objects is used to simulate a specified state?

mocks
stubs
interfaces
spies
fields

4. How does code coverage with tests affect product quality?

Directly proportional (increasing coverage by 20% improves quality by 20%)
Influences, but not directly proportional
Code coverage with tests has nothing to do with product quality

5. What are the 3 stages that a test can be divided into?

Arrange
Accommodation
Ability
Act
Assert

6. What should happen in the Act section of a unit test according to AAA?

calling the method under test with the parameters set in the previous section
setting up connections to external systems, databases and third-party APIs
initialization, setting up mocks, setting the data that will be passed to the method under test
verification of the method under test, verification of the correctness of the returned result and internal verification

7. What colors are commonly used in TDD stages?

red, green, blue
red, yellow, green
blue-green, yellow, black
colors are not used to represent TDD stages

8. What characteristics should unit tests have according to the F.I.R.S.T principle?

Obviousness
Repeatability
Independence
Speed
Coverage
Timeliness/Thoroughness

9. What should happen in the Arrange section of a unit test according to AAA?

calling the method under test with the parameters set in the previous section
setting up connections to external systems, databases and third-party APIs
initialization, setting up mocks, setting the data that will be passed to the method under test
verification of the method under test, verification of the correctness of the returned result and internal verification

10. How many tests do you need to write for one condition (one if without any other nested conditions) to cover it 100%?

1
2
3
4
impossible to determine

14. What characteristic of the F.I.R.S.T principle is being referred to when it says: "A test method should not depend on any data in the environment/instance in which it is running."

Repeatability
Obviousness
Independence
Coverage
Speed
Timeliness/Thoroughness

15. What is the approach where tests for functionality are developed first and then the implementation of that functionality itself

E2E
unit testing
integration testing
load testing
TDD

16. According to the testing pyramid, which type of tests are the most expensive?

E2E
Unit tests
Integration
The concept of 'testing pyramid' does not exist
The cost of different types of tests is approximately the same

17. According to the testing pyramid, what type of tests should be the most?

E2E
Integration tests
UI tests
Unit tests
The concept of the testing pyramid does not exist

18. Select from the list the libraries and tools used for testing JS code:

Jest
jasmine
JBehave
mocha
JUnit

19. How is test coverage calculated relative to requirements?

The total number of code lines is divided by the number of lines of code covered by the checks and multiplied by 100
The total number of stated requirements is divided by the number of requirements selected for testing and multiplied by 100
The number of lines of code covered by the checks is divided by the total number of code lines and multiplied by 100
The number of requirements selected for testing is divided by the total number of stated requirements and multiplied by 100
