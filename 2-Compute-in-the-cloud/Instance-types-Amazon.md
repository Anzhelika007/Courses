### Amazon EC2 instance types

1. `General purpose instances` provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:

- application servers
- gaming servers
- backend servers for enterprise applications
- small and medium databases

2. `Compute optimized instances` are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.

3. `Memory optimized instances` are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory.

4. `Accelerated computing instances` use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Examples of these functions include floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching.

In computing, a `hardware accelerator` is a component that can expedite data processing. Accelerated computing instances are ideal for workloads such as graphics applications, game streaming, and application streaming.

5. `Storage optimized instances` are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.

In computing, the term input/output operations per second `(IOPS)` is a metric that measures the performance of a storage device. It indicates how many different input or output operations a device can perform in one second. Storage optimized instances are designed to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to applications.
